# WMS — Delivery / Specs Status (Phase 3)

> **Live status file for the post-mockup phase.** This is the successor to `../mockups/MOCKUP_STATUS.md`

## ▶ Where we are

- **Mockup phase (Phase 2): COMPLETE** — both channels (ERP + PWA), edge-case hardened, on the shared `data.js`. See `../mockups/MOCKUP_STATUS.md`.
- **Execution-layer framework: SCAFFOLDED** — `delivery/` (35 files): orchestrator, host-integration map, cross-cutting registry, 16 common-rule files, 9 phase files (each with its planned-card list), the sub-phase template + 1 fully-worked reference card (`P03-S01`).
- **Host stack confirmed — this is a BROWNFIELD integration:**
  - **Backend:** new `WMS` module inside the existing **ASP.NET Core 3.1** modular monolith (Ocelot gateway) at `D:\CODE\TLC\sds-erp-back` (reuses identity/roles, EF Core 3.1, `OperationResult`/`APICustomException`, AutoMapper, Kendo grids).
  - **ERP front:** new `projects/wms` in the existing **Angular 14** workspace at `D:\CODE\TLC\sds-erp-front` (NgRx, Swagger-generated client, Nebular/Kendo, auth guards).
  - **PWA:** new `projects/wms-scanner` (Angular, **greenfield** — no PWA tooling in host today).
  - **DB:** **SQL Server 2014** (hard constraint — arrays → child tables, hand-rolled audit ledger).
  - Full detail: `01-orchestrator/HOST_INTEGRATION_MAP.md`.

## ▶ The goal & delivery sequence (LOCKED)

> **We finish the client doc → then the technical doc → then finalize the cards.** In order:

### 1. Client documentation — *first deliverable*
A **Word document (.docx) "specs with print screens"** that presents **every functionality** to the client.
- Organized by **section** (Master Data · Goods Reception · Putaway · Stock-Out · Inventory Operations · Reports) and **channel** (ERP screens + PWA scanner screens).
- For each screen/feature: a **screenshot** of the mockup + a short description of what it does and how to use it.
- Source = the mockups (`../mockups/*.html`); served locally and screenshotted. Built with the **docx skill**.
- ⚠ Known caveat: the preview screenshotter has been intermittently flaky in this project — capture may take iteration (re-attempt / fallback).

### 2. Technical documentation + cost estimation — *second deliverable*
A **Man/Days estimation** as a **simple doc, by page name and functionality** (one line per screen/feature with its effort) — the first-cut estimate. Method + tiers: `01-orchestrator/ESTIMATION_GUIDE.md`; calibrate against `../docs/BUILD_LOG.md`.

### 3. Finalize the build cards — *third deliverable*
- **Decompose Phase 0 + Phase 1 into full build cards** (the phase files already list the planned cards) — **this proves the velocity and unblocks everything.**
- **Generate `COST_MODEL.xlsx`** from those cards once tiers are calibrated against `../docs/BUILD_LOG.md` (the detailed bottom-up estimate, successor to the simple page-level one).
- **Fan out the remaining phases' cards** in dependency order (`01-orchestrator/PHASE_DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md`).

## ▶ Open decisions (don't lose — flagged across the framework)

Recorded with recommendations in `01-orchestrator/HOST_INTEGRATION_MAP.md` §E. #1–#3 shape every Phase-0 card; #4–#5 affect the PWA cards.

1. **Schema authoring:** EF migrations vs DBA SQL scripts → *rec: EF migrations (DDL seeded from `data.js`).*
2. **Tenant/site scoping:** extend host `User`/`UserClaim` vs WMS-side scope table → *rec: WMS-side (don't touch shared Auth schema).*
3. **Runtime:** stay on .NET Core 3.1 vs upgrade WMS module → *rec: stay (ADR the EOL risk).*
4. **PWA placement:** `projects/wms-scanner` in workspace vs separate repo → *rec: same workspace.*
5. **PWA offline:** hard v1 requirement vs online-only → *biggest cost swing; confirm with client.*

## ▶ Restart prompt for a new session

> Paste this into a fresh session to resume with full context.

```
We're on the WMS 3PL project. The mockup phase (Phase 2) is complete and the delivery/specs
framework is scaffolded. Before doing anything, read these for context:
  1. delivery/DELIVERY_STATUS.md   (current state, the LOCKED sequence, open decisions, this prompt)
  2. delivery/01-orchestrator/PROJECT_ORCHESTRATOR.md
  3. mockups/MOCKUP_STATUS.md       (what the mockups cover)
  4. CLAUDE.md + docs/GLOSSARY.md   (vocabulary & rules)

We are in Phase 3 (specs delivery). The LOCKED sequence is:
  (1) CLIENT DOCUMENTATION  →  (2) TECHNICAL DOC + Man/Days estimation  →  (3) finalize build cards.

START WITH DELIVERABLE 1 — the CLIENT DOCUMENTATION:
Generate a Word document (.docx) — a "functional specs with print screens" guide for the client —
that presents EVERY WMS functionality. Organize it by section (Master Data, Goods Reception,
Putaway, Stock-Out, Inventory Operations, Reports) and cover BOTH channels (ERP screens + PWA
scanner screens). For each screen/feature: a screenshot of the mockup + a short description of what
it does and how to use it. Source = the mockups in mockups/*.html (serve locally, screenshot each
screen). Use the docx skill. Note: the preview screenshotter has been intermittently flaky here —
re-attempt or fall back if it stalls.

FIRST, propose the document's table of contents (the screens to include, in order, per section and
channel) and confirm it with me BEFORE capturing all screenshots and assembling the full document.
Do NOT write any application code — we are producing documentation, not implementing features.
```
