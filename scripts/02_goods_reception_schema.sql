   WMS (3PL) — DATABASE SCHEMA
   SECTION 02: GOODS RECEPTION  +  SHARED OPERATIONAL CORE
               (tables only — NO views, NO procedures)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Target engine : Microsoft SQL Server 2014  (hard constraint)
   Module        : WMS — client-owned stock in a 3PL warehouse
   Run order     : AFTER 01_master_data_schema.sql (every table here FKs back to
                   Master Data — clients, sites, products, locations, suppliers,
                   carriers, reason codes, packaging levels, UoM).

   WHY THIS FILE COVERS MORE THAN "RECEIVING"
   ------------------------------------------
   Goods Reception is the FIRST stock-creating process. The act of receiving
   mints the records the WHOLE downstream warehouse runs on:
     * the License Plate (wmslpn) — the stock-bearing handling unit, and
     * the transaction ledger (wmstxn) — the append-only "every movement" log.
   Because of that, this file deliberately creates the **shared operational
   core** (GROUP A) alongside the Goods-Reception tables (GROUP B):

     GROUP A — Shared operational core (created here, reused everywhere)
       wmslpn, wmslpnserial          ← the stock record + explicit serial rows
       wmstxn                         ← append-only audit ledger (every movement)
       wmsattachment                  ← EDM-backed photo justification (polymorphic)

     GROUP B — Goods Reception
       wmsasn, wmsasnline             ← inbound order / ASN (status DERIVED)
       wmsreceipt, wmsreceiptline     ← the physical receive event (what arrived)
       wmspallet, wmspalletline,      ← mixed/aggregate pallet (decomposes at putaway)
         wmspalletlineserial
       wmsinspection                  ← formal QC accept/reject decision
       wmsgrn, wmsgrnline             ← Goods Received Note (one per receipt)
       wmsrefusal                     ← delivery refused at the door (NO stock minted)

   ANALYSIS OF THE ADJACENT SECTIONS (per the request to look ahead)
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   * PUTAWAY (Section 03) needs **NO new tables**. Its worklist is derived
     (wmslpn WHERE status='to-putaway'  +  wmspallet WHERE status='to-putaway'),
     its history is the ledger (wmstxn WHERE type='putaway'), and every placement
     mutates wmslpn (status→available, loc=bin) / decomposes a wmspallet into child
     wmslpn rows + writes a wmstxn. Capacity & client-area segregation are enforced
     in app logic against wmslocation limits — not as DDL. The shared core below is
     therefore designed to serve the full LPN lifecycle so Putaway never alters it.
   * STOCK-OUT (Section 04/05) and INVENTORY OPS (Section 05) DO need their own
     tables (wmsoutbound / wmsoutboundline / wmsallocation / wmsshipment*, plus
     move/transfer/count/physical/repack/return/adjustment). They build on this
     same wmslpn + wmstxn core and are scripted in their own files (05_/06_). The
     wmslpn.status CHECK and the wmstxn.type CHECK below already include their
     values so those scripts add tables only — never ALTER these.

   CONVENTIONS HONOURED (identical to 01_master_data_schema.sql)
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   * Table names lower-case, prefixed "wms"; column names lower-case, no spaces.
   * Every table has id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY. Human/business ids
     (LPN-…, ASN-…, RCV-…, GRN-…, PLT-…, INS-…, REF-…, TXN-…) are a separate
     unique "code" business-key column — NEVER the PK.
   * Quantities/weights DECIMAL(18,3); packaging factors DECIMAL(18,4); dates
     DATETIME2; enums = VARCHAR guarded by CHECK (values match DATA_MODEL.md).
   * No JSON / OPENJSON, no temporal tables, no 2016+ features (SQL 2014).
   * Audit columns (createdby/createdat/editby/edittime) on aggregate roots only;
     pure child/link tables omit them (written within the parent's unit of work).
   * USER references (createdby/editby/<role>by/assignee/userid) are INT and point
     at [dbo].[Users].[Id] LOGICALLY — NOT FK-bound (same posture as 01: lets host
     users deactivate without blocking, and removes a load-order dependency on the
     host identity table).
   * Re-run safe: every CREATE guarded by IF OBJECT_ID(...) IS NULL; NO DROPs.

   IMAGE / PHOTO UPLOADS (per the explicit instruction)
   ----------------------------------------------------
   Images are NOT stored as rows-per-image business tables. A single polymorphic
   wmsattachment table references a document already held in the EDM system by its
   DOCID, and denormalises just enough metadata (docname / doctype) to render a
   list WITHOUT joining to EDM, plus a generated docthumbnail so a grid never has
   to download the full asset on every view. See wmsattachment.

   HOW TO RUN
   ----------
   USE [WMS];  -- (or the per-agency DMS_xx database)
   -- run 01_master_data_schema.sql first, then this file, then the seed files.

/* wmsasn ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   SCREEN : erp-gr-asn.html (list + create/edit). Read by erp-gr-receipt.html
            (Receive against ASN) and pwa-gr-receive.html.
   PURPOSE: Advance Shipment Notice header — the expected inbound for a client at
            a site, from an optional supplier. The lifecycle status
            (open -> partial -> closed) is DERIVED from the lines' received-vs-
            expected and is NEVER stored (asnStatus()). The ONLY persisted state
            is the explicit lifecycle override in "state": a delivery refused at
            the door (-> 'refused', via wmsrefusal) or a voided ASN (-> 'cancelled');
            NULL means "live, status is derived". "assignee" carries the optional
            work-item owner for the receiving queue (CC-09). The VOID/cancel path
            (cancelAsn — erp-gr-asn.html "Void ASN" modal) records its reason + note +
            actor + timestamp in the cancel* columns; the mock's void reason list is
            screen-local (VOID_REASONS), so it is stored as free text rather than an FK
            (promote to a 'void' reason domain later if it must be configurable). Refusal
            reason capture lives on wmsrefusal instead (it also carries supplier/carrier
            return detail). */

            the status-derived putaway/inspect queues (CC-09). Capacity & client-
            area segregation are enforced in APP LOGIC at putaway (against

   GROUP A.2 — TRANSACTION LEDGER  (append-only "every movement" log)
   ============================================================================ */

/* wmstxn ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   SCREEN : written by EVERY stock-mutating action across all sections (logTxn);
            READ by the Reports section (erp-rpt-txns / stockcard / trace) and by
            the Putaway/Stock-Out "Completed/Dispatched" history tabs.
   PURPOSE: The append-only audit ledger — the single answer to "track every
            movement (movements, logs, quantities)". One row per committed
            mutation (BLOCKING_RULES: an action that writes no audit row is a bug).
            INSERT-ONLY by convention — no UPDATE/DELETE (optionally DENY for the
            app login); production intent is strict immutability with full actor
            (DATA_MODEL gap #6). "type" spans every section so downstream scripts
            add tables, never ALTER this CHECK. "qty" is signed for adjustments.
            from/to are modelled as nullable location FKs (the common
            receive/putaway/move case); cross-site (transfer) and no-location
            events (refuse) carry the human description in "note" + the linked
            document in "ref". */

   SCREEN : the shared photos widget across erp-gr-receipt / erp-gr-inspect /

   PURPOSE: Optional photo/document evidence attached to a WMS document (header) or
            a line. PER THE EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION the image bytes are NOT stored here
            — the asset lives in the EDM system and is referenced by "docid"; this
            table denormalises just enough EDM metadata (docname/doctype) to render
            a list WITHOUT joining to EDM, plus a generated "docthumbnail" so a grid
            never downloads the full asset on every view. POLYMORPHIC ownership: it
            attaches to many entity kinds via (entitytype, entityid) — the WMS row
            it belongs to — with "level" = header|line and "lineref" naming the line
            (a line index or an LPN code) for line-level photos. Every add/remove
            also writes an 'attach'/'attach-remove' row to wmstxn (audited). */

   END OF GOODS RECEPTION + SHARED OPERATIONAL CORE SCHEMA
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   WMS tables created (15):
     Shared core   : wmslpn, wmslpnserial, wmstxn, wmsattachment
     ASN           : wmsasn, wmsasnline
     Receive       : wmsreceipt, wmsreceiptline
     Mixed pallet  : wmspallet, wmspalletline, wmspalletlineserial
     Inspection    : wmsinspection
     GRN           : wmsgrn, wmsgrnline
     Refusal       : wmsrefusal

   Referenced (from 01_master_data_schema.sql): wmsclient, wmssite, wmsproduct,
     wmslocation, wmssupplier, wmscarrier, wmsreason, wmspackaginglevel, wmsuom.
   Referenced logically (NOT FK-bound): [dbo].[Users] (all *by / userid / assignee).

   PUTAWAY (Section 03) adds NO tables — it operates entirely on wmslpn (status
   to-putaway -> available + split children), wmspallet (decomposition), wmslocation
   (capacity/segregation), and wmstxn (type='putaway' history). Stock-Out and
   Inventory-Ops get their own scripts (05_/06_) building on this same core.

   NOT in this file (by design): views and stored procedures — built per-screen
   during the dev cards. Reference/seed rows live in 02_goods_reception_seed.sql.

   VERIFICATION PASS (2026-06-24) — reconciled field-by-field against the 5 ERP
   mockups (erp-gr-asn / receipt / inspect / grn / labels), the PWA receive/inspect
   screens, and every logTxn()/status mutation in mockups/assets/data.js. Fixes
   applied vs the first draft:
     * wmstxn.type CHECK — added 'transfer-loss','transfer-cancel','park' (these
       downstream events are logged by the transfer + putaway-overflow flows; the
       draft would have REJECTED them — the shared CHECK must list every section's
       event because later scripts add tables, never ALTER this CHECK). Now 21 types.
     * wmslpn.status CHECK — added 'disposed','lost' (terminal states set by the
       Section-05 disposal and Section-06 transfer-short flows). Now 14 statuses.
     * wmsasn — added cancelreason/cancelnote/cancelledby/cancelledat (the Void-ASN
       modal captured a reason+note that the draft had nowhere to persist).
     * wmsgrn — added receivedby/inspectedby (the printed GRN signature block).
   The seed adds the 'receipt'/'refuse'/'discrepancy' reason domains the Receive +
   Refuse screens CONSUME (defined in data.js but absent from 01's reason seed).
   CROSS-SECTION GAP (Master Data, file 01): inline product creation on Receive has a
   role-based pending/unverified policy, but wmsproduct has no verification flag —
   recommend the MD team add e.g. verificationstatus VARCHAR(20) ('verified'|'pending').
